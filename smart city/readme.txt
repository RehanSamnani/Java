🚀 Step-by-Step Approach to Building the User Management System
This guide will help you think like a developer by breaking down the problem logically and approaching it step by step.

📝 Step 1: Understand the Problem Statement
We need to build a User Management System that allows users to:

Register with their name, email, password, and role (Citizen/Admin).
Store user details securely in a file.
Login by verifying their credentials.
Grant access based on the user role.
Handle errors such as duplicate emails and incorrect passwords.
📝 Step 2: Break Down the Problem into Smaller Parts
To build this system, we need to solve the following problems:

1️⃣ Registration System
Get user input (name, email, password, role).
Validate the input (ensure fields are not empty).
Check if the email is already registered.
If not registered, store the user details in a file.
Display success or error messages.
2️⃣ Login System
Get user input (email, password).
Read stored user details from the file.
Check if the email exists.
Verify if the password matches.
If correct, grant access based on the role.
If incorrect, display error messages.
3️⃣ File Handling
Store user details securely in a file.
Read and verify user details during login.
Handle errors like missing files or corrupted data.
4️⃣ Exception Handling
Prevent duplicate registrations.
Handle incorrect inputs.
Show meaningful error messages.
📝 Step 3: Define the Data and Operations
We need to define:

Data structure → Users will have name, email, password, role.
Operations → Registration, login, file handling.
💡 Key Questions to Ask Before Coding
Where will user data be stored?

In a text file (users.txt).
How will data be stored in the file?

Each user's details will be saved as a comma-separated value (CSV) format:

Copy
Edit
Name,Email,Password,Role
John Doe,john@example.com,pass123,Citizen
How will the system check for duplicate emails?

By reading the file and checking if the entered email already exists.
How will the login system verify user credentials?

By matching the entered email and password with the stored data.
How will role-based access work?

If the role is Admin, grant access to the admin panel.
If the role is Citizen, grant access to citizen services.
📝 Step 4: Identify the Tools and Concepts Needed
To implement this system, we will use:
✔ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) → To create a User class.
✔ File Handling → To read/write user data in a text file.
✔ String Manipulation → To parse and validate input.
✔ Exception Handling → To catch errors like missing files or wrong input.

📝 Step 5: Design the Logical Flow of the Program
Before writing code, it's important to design the system flow.

🔹 Registration Flow
1️⃣ Ask the user for name, email, password, role.
2️⃣ Check if all fields are filled (no empty input).
3️⃣ Check if the email already exists in the file.

If yes, show an error: "Email already registered!".
If no, proceed to step 4.
4️⃣ Save the user details to users.txt.
5️⃣ Show "Registration Successful!" message.
🔹 Login Flow
1️⃣ Ask the user for email and password.
2️⃣ Read users.txt and check if the email exists.

If email is not found, show error: "User not found. Please register.".
3️⃣ If email exists, check if the password is correct.
If password is incorrect, show error: "Incorrect password. Try again.".
If password matches, proceed to step 4.
4️⃣ Grant access based on user role.
If Admin, show "Welcome, Admin. Access granted!".
If Citizen, show "Welcome, Citizen. You have limited access.".
📝 Step 6: Plan for Error Handling & Edge Cases
It's critical to plan for problems before writing code.

🔹 Edge Cases
Empty Inputs → Prevent users from leaving fields blank.
Invalid Email Format → Ensure email contains @ and a domain.
Weak Passwords → Enforce a password rule (e.g., at least 6 characters).
Case Sensitivity → Ensure login checks are case-insensitive.
File Not Found → If users.txt is missing, create a new file automatically.
🔹 Common Errors to Handle
Error Scenario	Solution
User enters an empty name, email, or password	Show "All fields are required!"
User enters an invalid role	Show "Invalid role! Please enter 'Citizen' or 'Admin'."
Email already exists	Show "Email already registered!"
File users.txt is missing	Create a new file automatically
Password does not match	Show "Incorrect password. Try again!"
Email is not found in database	Show "User not found. Please register."
📝 Step 7: Convert the Plan into Code
After this planning process, the next step is writing the actual code by implementing each of these logical steps in Java.

🚀 Summary of Steps to Solve the Problem
1️⃣ Understand the problem statement → What does the system need to do?
2️⃣ Break it into smaller tasks → Registration, login, file handling.
3️⃣ Define the data and operations → What data do we store? How do we use it?
4️⃣ Choose the right tools → Java, OOP, file handling, exception handling.
5️⃣ Design the program flow → Plan the steps before writing code.
6️⃣ Think about errors and edge cases → Prevent common mistakes.
7️⃣ Write and test the code → Now that you have a plan, coding will be easier.

🌟 Next Steps
🔹 Start Coding → Now that you have a structured plan, write the Java program step by step.
🔹 Test the System → Try registering and logging in, and check for errors.
🔹 Improve Security → Add password encryption.
🔹 Enhance Features → Use a database instead of file storage.
🔹 Build a GUI → Create a visual interface using JavaFX.

🔔 Final Note: Think Like a Developer
When solving a problem:
✔ Break it into smaller steps.
✔ Think about edge cases and errors.
✔ Plan before coding.
✔ Test and improve.

🚀 Now you're ready to build the User Management System!
